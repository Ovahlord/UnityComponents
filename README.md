** Convenience **
1. SpringArm - a retractable arm which can collide with the environment and adjust its length accordingly. Inspired by the namegiving counterpart in the Unreal Engine, you may think of it as a selfie-stick with a spring instead of a stick
2. TransformFollower - as the name implies, this small component is meant to make one gameobject following another. You can alter the follow behavior by adding offsets to the target follow position as well as smoothing out the movement

** StateMachine **
A general purpose StateMachine and its State class. This API allows you to handle complex code behavior in a nice and isolated manner. The machine comes with a generic underlying type which allows you to create cross-interactions between the object holder and the machine itself
